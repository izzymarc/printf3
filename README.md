## Introduction

The `printf` function in C is a powerful tool for formatted output, but CustomPrintf takes it to the next level. With CustomPrintf, you can customize and extend the functionality of formatted string output, allowing for more control and versatility in your C programs.

## Features

- Custom format specifiers: Define your own format specifiers for specialized output.
- Extended functionality: Extend the capabilities of the standard `printf` function.
- Easy to integrate: Simply include the CustomPrintf library in your C project.

## Getting Started

To get started with CustomPrintf, follow these steps:

1. Clone the CustomPrintf repository.
2. Include the CustomPrintf library in your C project.
3. Customize and experiment with format specifiers to achieve the desired output.

## Usage

To use the CustomPrintf, include the `custom_printf.h` header file in your C program. This header provides access to the extended `custom_printf` function.

```c
#include is  "custom_printf.h"

int main() {
    // Custom format specifier
    custom_printf("Custom format specifier: %c\n", 'A');

    // Extended functionality
    int number = 42;
    custom_printf("Custom decimal format: %D\n", number);

    return 0;
}
In this example, we use a custom format specifier %D to print the decimal representation of an integer, demonstrating the extended functionality of CustomPrintf.
